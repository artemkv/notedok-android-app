EPIC: View


STORY: Search

As a regular user, I want to be able to search for notes that contain certain words/tags in titles.

* Search button
* Switches to the search activity
* User can type search string in the textbox
* Textbox has a watermark saying "Search in titles"
* User can use voice
* Once user start typing, the cross appears to the right of the textbox that allows to erase all the entered text
* User can go back to the note list by clicking on the arrow
* Auto-suggest contains the relevant stuff
* Once you click on search button, the app goes to the search results, which is the note list view showing the search string and the number of results
* For the rest, look like it is done in gmail and try to copy


STORY: Partial wiki rendering on card view

As a regular user, I want to see my note properly formatted in the partial view.

* Links are NOT clickable
* When clicking on the link, should simply go to the detail view
* For the rest - all what is supported for the web, should be supported here
